Used various settings while running recorder example


Bottom line best result (nr 8.)

Runtime traces in file "runtime logs 220106.txt". In this file the number before the ********** is the experiment number.
             
defaults:

        MIDIManager::CloseInPorts();  recorder.cpp:317  uncommented/on
        proc_lock.lock();   sequencer.cpp: 1255         uncommented
        proc_lock.unlock(); sequencer.cpp 1267          uncommented 
        No notes played during recording phase

1.     CloseInPorts() commented
       proc_lock      uncommented = default
       RESULT:        hangs after calling proc_lock.lock()

2.     CloseInPorts()  uncommented = default
       proc_lock       uncommented = default
       RESULT:         hangs after calling proc_lock.lock()

3.     CloseInPorts()  uncommented = default
       proc_lock       commented
       RESULT:         hangs just before     sequencer.GoToZero();  main.cpp:1435  

4.                  
     proc_lock.lock();  and unlock in sequencer.stop commented
     closeInPorts in recorder also commented

     RESULT: hangs also later , at the same position as with uncommented closeInPorts
             that is: just before     sequencer.GoToZero();       
                         sequencer.Start();  (app_main():1435 )
      
5.  call closeInPorts in recorder = default
    proc_lock.lock(); in sequencer Stop 1255 1267 uncommented = default
    REPLACE std::thread(StaticStopProc, this).detach(); in MIDISequencer::TickProc sequencer.cpp:1436 by Stop()
    RESULT: keeps on sequencing infinitely
            no logs from MIDISequencer::Stop()  after proc_lock.lock(); (next expt will be without lock/unlock

6.  call closeInPorts in recorder = default
    proc_lock.lock(); in sequencer Stop 1255 1267 commented
    REPLACE std::thread(StaticStopProc, this).detach(); in MIDISequencer::TickProc sequencer.cpp:1436 by Stop()
    RESULT:  comes to the point where input should start playing


7. 
    call closeInPorts in recorder = default
    proc_lock.lock(); in sequencer Stop 1255 1267 commented
    REPLACE std::thread(StaticStopProc, this).detach(); in MIDISequencer::TickProc sequencer.cpp:1436 by Stop() NOT SURE ABOUT THIS SETTING
    ENTER SOME DIFFERENT NOTES
    RESULT: PLAYS SOMETHING AFTER RECORDING !
        After BEAT 1 of recording: Auto stopping the sequencer: StaticStopProc called at time 627

        Then: "NEW" ERROR (see runtime investigation 220106.txt, item 7.)


8.  call closeInPorts in recorder = default
    proc_lock.lock(); in sequencer Stop 1255 1267 commented
    REPLACE std::thread(StaticStopProc, this).detach(); in MIDISequencer::TickProc sequencer.cpp:1436 by Stop()
    Increased number of recorded measures to 15:
	MIDIClockTime t = sequencer.MeasToMIDI(15,0); //endMeasure, endBeat record the first 6 beats main.ccp:1419
	recorder.SetEndRecTime(t);
    Increased waiting time before calling recorder.Stop() to 1 minute:
        MIDITimer::Wait(60000) main.cpp:1428
    ENTER MULTIPLE DIFFERENT NOTES

    RESULT: Playing recorded notes  (always the same note, so not perfect.....)
            produces multiple crashes without reboot: "E (96730) task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered. The following tasks did not reset the watchdog in time"
